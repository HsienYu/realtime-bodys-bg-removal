Follow the interactive prompts to configure the application:

1. **Model selection**:

2. **ONNX option**:
   - Enter 1 to use ONNX, 0 to use standard PyTorch model

3. **Camera selection**:
   - Select from available cameras

4. **Resolution**:
   - Choose from preset resolutions (HD, Full HD)

5. **Detection confidence**:
   - Set the confidence threshold (0.1-0.9, recommended 0.3-0.5)
   - Lower values detect bodies at greater distances but may increase false positives

6. **Edge feathering**:
   - Set the amount of edge feathering (0-20)
   - Higher values create smoother transitions at edges
   - 0 for sharp edges, 10 recommended for natural look

7. **Background mode**:
   - 0: Green screen
   - 1: Blue screen
   - 2: Custom color (you'll be prompted for RGB values)
   - 3: Transparent background (outputs RGBA with transparent bodies)

   - Requires NDI Tools installation (https://ndi.video/tools/)
   - Test NDI setup with: `python test_ndi.py`

## Keyboard Controls

While the application is running:

- **Q**: Quit the application
- **H**: Toggle display of information overlay
- **B**: Toggle inclusion of area between multiple bodies
- **M**: Cycle through all 12 background modes (in enhanced versions)
- **1-8**: Direct mode selection hotkeys (in enhanced versions)
- **+/-**: Increase/decrease processing frequency (lower frequency = higher performance)
- **[ / ]**: Adjust background frame offset in original background modes (time-delay effect)

**Split-Screen Controls (app_enhanced_split.py only):**
- **I**: Effect on LEFT side only (center to left)
- **O**: Effect on RIGHT side only (center to right)
- **P**: FULL effect across entire frame

## Performance Tips

- Use smaller models (yolov8n-seg, yolov8s-seg) for better performance
- Enable ONNX with CoreML on Apple Silicon for 2-3x speed boost (automatic in app_enhanced.py)
- Use the processing frequency control (+/-) to balance quality and performance
- Run at lower resolutions for better framerates
- On Apple Silicon, app_enhanced.py automatically uses FP16 and MPS optimization
- Use `app_enhanced_m3_max_stable.py` for maximum performance on M3 Max
- Configure hardware-specific settings in `performance_config.yaml` or `performance_config_m3_max.yaml`

## Syphon Integration

When Syphon is enabled, the output can be used in applications like OBS Studio:

1. Install the obs-syphon plugin in OBS
2. Add a Syphon Client source
3. Select "PersonBackgroundRemoval" as the source
4. For transparent mode, ensure "Allow Transparency" is checked

See [SYPHON_SETUP.md](SYPHON_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

## NDI Integration

NDI (Network Device Interface) allows professional streaming over network:

1. Install NDI Tools from https://ndi.video/tools/
2. Install Python package: `pip install ndi-python`
3. Test NDI setup: `python test_ndi.py`
4. Enable NDI when prompted in the application
5. Look for "PersonBackgroundRemoval" in NDI-compatible apps (OBS, vMix, etc.)

**Features:**
- Async frame publishing for stable transmission
- Automatic BGRA format conversion
- Queue management to prevent frame backup
- Performance statistics logging
- Supports both RGB and RGBA (transparent) modes

## Performance Configuration

The application includes YAML configuration files for hardware-specific tuning:

### General Configuration (`performance_config.yaml`)
- Balanced settings for most hardware
- Adaptive quality control
- 30 FPS target

### M3 Max Configuration (`performance_config_m3_max.yaml`)
- Optimized for Apple M3 Max chips
- 60 FPS target
- Larger buffers for stability
- CoreML execution provider

**Settings Tool:**
```bash
python optimize_settings.py
```
Generates recommended configuration based on your use case.

## Troubleshooting

- **Low FPS**: Try a smaller model, lower resolution, or increase the processing interval
- **Poor segmentation**: Try a larger model (yolov8m-seg, yolov8l-seg) or adjust confidence (try 0.3)
- **Edge artifacts**: Increase the feathering amount for smoother edges
- **Syphon not working**: Ensure you have the correct plugins installed in the receiving application
- **NDI not working**: Run `python test_ndi.py` to verify installation
- **Incomplete background replacement**: Lower confidence threshold to 0.3 and try yolov8m-seg model
- **H.264 codec warnings (RTSP)**: These are usually harmless; try adding `?tcp` to RTSP URL if issues persist
- **On Apple Silicon**: app_enhanced.py automatically uses MPS and FP16 for 2-3x performance boost
