## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- macOS (for Syphon support)
- Webcam or other camera input
- Packages listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-bodys-bg-removal.git
   cd realtime-bodys-bg-removal
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. For Syphon support, see [SYPHON_SETUP.md](SYPHON_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

## Usage

### Standard Version
Run the standard application with:

```bash
python app_with_contours_feather.py
```

### Enhanced Version
Run the enhanced version with RTSP support and custom backgrounds:

```bash
python app_enhanced.py
```

### M3 Max Performance Optimized Version (RECOMMENDED for MacBook Pro M3 Max) ðŸš€
Run the performance-optimized version with all features plus 3-4x speed improvement:

```bash
python app_enhanced_m3_max.py
```

**Expected Performance on M3 Max:**
- YOLOv8n-seg: 35-45 FPS (vs 23 FPS original)
- YOLOv8s-seg: 25-35 FPS (vs 16 FPS original)
- All 12 background modes supported
- RTSP/RTMP + Video files + Syphon + NDI

See [ENHANCED_FEATURES.md](ENHANCED_FEATURES.md) for detailed documentation of the features including:
- RTSP/RTMP video input support
- Custom background images
- Original video background modes
- Video file processing
- 12 total background modes

Follow the interactive prompts to configure the application:

1. **Model selection**: 
   - Choose a YOLOv8 segmentation model (0-4, smaller number = faster but less accurate)

2. **ONNX option**:
   - Enter 1 to use ONNX, 0 to use standard PyTorch model

3. **Camera selection**:
   - Select from available cameras

4. **Resolution**:
   - Choose from preset resolutions (HD, Full HD)

5. **Detection confidence**:
   - Set the confidence threshold (0.1-0.9, recommended 0.3-0.5)
   - Lower values detect bodies at greater distances but may increase false positives

6. **Edge feathering**:
   - Set the amount of edge feathering (0-20)
   - Higher values create smoother transitions at edges
   - 0 for sharp edges, 10 recommended for natural look

7. **Background mode**:
   - 0: Green screen
   - 1: Blue screen
   - 2: Custom color (you'll be prompted for RGB values)
   - 3: Transparent background (outputs RGBA with transparent bodies)

8. **Syphon output**:
   - Enable Syphon to output to other applications (macOS only)

## Keyboard Controls

While the application is running:

- **Q**: Quit the application
- **H**: Toggle display of information overlay
- **B**: Toggle inclusion of area between multiple bodies
- **+/-**: Increase/decrease processing frequency (lower frequency = higher performance)

## Performance Tips

- Use smaller models (yolov8n-seg, yolov8s-seg) for better performance
- Enable ONNX for potential performance gains
- Use the processing frequency control (+/-) to balance quality and performance
- Run at lower resolutions for better framerates

## Syphon Integration

When Syphon is enabled, the output can be used in applications like OBS Studio:

1. Install the obs-syphon plugin in OBS
2. Add a Syphon Client source
3. Select "PersonBackgroundRemoval" as the source
4. For transparent mode, ensure "Allow Transparency" is checked

See [SYPHON_SETUP.md](SYPHON_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

## Troubleshooting

- **Low FPS**: Try a smaller model, lower resolution, or increase the processing interval
- **Poor segmentation**: Try a larger model (yolov8m-seg, yolov8l-seg) or adjust confidence
- **Edge artifacts**: Increase the feathering amount for smoother edges
- **Syphon not working**: Ensure you have the correct plugins installed in the receiving application
